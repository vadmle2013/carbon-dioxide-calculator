# carbon dioxide calculator
Our project is a carbon dioxide calculator. This means that, based on a few questions the code asks you, taking into account your answers, it will calculate whether you have a low, medium, or low carbon footprint, and therefore, whether you need to reduce it for the sake of the environment.

For the program to work properly, you need to download the following libraries:
- import os
- import re
- import difflib
- import pandas as pd

What we want to achieve and the impact of our code is that when people see the great damage they are causing to the planet, they will become more aware of what they are doing and try to reduce their carbon footprint, thus helping to make a difference and reduce environmental pollution.
